# map_merge
---
This project's goal is merge 2 Visual-SfM model more faster than using Visual-SfM tools. If we have 274 images that contain 2 building, Visual-SfM takes 57.5minutes but if seperate 274 images to 136 images and 143 images it takes 13.1 minutes and 16.3 minutes each (no GPU). Code takes less than 1 minute.
